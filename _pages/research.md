## Research

### Climate Impacts on the Length of Sea Ice Season and Ecosystem Response
**Supervisor:** Prof. Paul Myers, University of Alberta  
**Duration:** July 2024 – October 2024

This research project focuses on understanding the changes in sea ice concentration and thickness in Baffin Bay and Hudson Bay, with an emphasis on the spatial structures of these changes. The project also examines the impacts of these changes on marine ecosystems, particularly phytoplankton productivity and biomass productivity. My role involves:

- Analyzing historical and recent data on sea ice concentration and thickness.
- Evaluating the length of the ice-free season by studying sea ice breakup and freeze-up processes.
- Investigating the relationship between sea ice changes and biogeochemical cycles in the Canadian Arctic.

### Land Use Changes and Evaluation of Habitat Quality in China’s Coastal Zone
**Supervisor:** Prof. Chengyi Zhao, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology  
**Duration:** March 2023 – April 2024

In this project, I coupled the PLUS (Patch-generating Land Use Simulation) model and the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model to predict the spatial distribution of land use changes and assess habitat quality from 2020 to 2060 under various SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) scenarios. My contributions include:

- Modeling land use changes using PLUS and predicting their impacts on habitat quality.
- Quantitatively assessing habitat quality under different climate and land use scenarios.
- Identifying the driving forces behind changes in habitat quality and the impact of land cover changes on ecosystem degradation.

### Anthropogenic Climate Change Impact on Runoff
**Supervisor:** Prof. Buda Su, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology  
**Duration:** September 2022 – February 2024

This research examines how anthropogenic climate change affects the runoff patterns in the upper Yangtze River basin. The study involves comparing the impacts of natural variability and human-induced climate change on river discharge. Key tasks include:

- Analyzing long-term discharge data from 1900 to 2099 under different climate forcings.
- Using machine learning models to predict future runoff patterns and assess the impacts of climate change.
- Providing insights for sustainable water resource management in the face of climate change.

### Research Interests
- **Climate Change and Ecosystem Dynamics:** Exploring how climate change impacts marine and terrestrial ecosystems.
- **Hydrological Modeling:** Investigating the effects of climate change on water resources and hydrological cycles.
- **Extreme Weather Events and Adaptation Strategies:** Understanding and developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events.
- **Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC):** Studying the effects of land use changes on ecosystem services and biodiversity.
