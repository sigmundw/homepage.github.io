### Climate Impacts on the Length of Sea Ice Season and Ecosystem Response
**Supervisor:** Prof. Paul Myers, [pmyers@ualberta.ca](pmyers@ualberta.ca)

**Duration:** July 2024 – October 2024

- Analyzed the changes in sea ice concentration and thickness and their spatial structure in Baffin Bay and Hudson Bay.
- Evaluated the changes of ice free season by looking at sea ice breakup and freeze-up processes.
- Examined the impact on ecosystem including phytoplankton productivity and biomass productivity.


### Land Use Changes and Evaluation of Habitat Quality in China’s Coastal Zone
**Supervisor:** Prof. Chengyi Zhao, [zhaocy@nuist.edu.cn](zhaocy@nuist.edu.cn)

**Duration:** March 2023 – April 2024

- Simulated land use changes using PLUS and predicting their impacts on habitat quality.
- Quantitatively assessed habitat quality under different scenarios.
- Identified the driving forces behind changes in habitat quality and the impact of land cover changes on ecosystem degradation.

### Anthropogenic Climate Change Impact on Runoff
**Supervisor:** Prof. Buda Su, [subd@nuist.edu.cn](subd@nuist.edu.cn)

**Duration:** September 2022 – February 2024
<img src="https://sigmundw.github.io/images/cuntan.png" alt="Cuntan Image" width="300" align="right" style="margin-left: 20px;"/>
- Constructed a Random Forest model using temperature and precipitation under different scenarios to predict runoff patterns.
- Evaluated the anthropogenic climate change on runoff by comparing discharge under “anthropogenic + natural” forcing and the discharge under “natural” forcing
- Identified the shifts in annual, monthly and extreme discharge patterns.
