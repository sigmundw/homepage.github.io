I am a fourth year undergraduate student majoring in physical geography and resource environment at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Buda Su](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Su-Buda). You can find my CV here: [Junhao Wang's CV](../assets/JunhaoWang_CV.pdf).
I have always been intrigued by the complex interactions between climate and water in different ecosystems. 

**My research interests include:**
- Hydroclimatology
- Climate change impacts and adaptation
- Ecosystem and landscape
- Arctic oceanography
- Land Use and Cover Change (LUCC)

Now I am doing a research internship in [the department of Earth and Atmoshperic Sciences, University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/earth-sciences/index.html) with [Prof. Paul Myers](https://apps.ualberta.ca/directory/person/pmyers) featuring in “Climate impacts on the length of sea ice season and ecosystem response”.
